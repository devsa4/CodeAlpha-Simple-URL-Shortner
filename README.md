# CodeAlpha-Simple-URL-Shortner
This repository contains a simple and efficient URL shortener service built using Flask and SQLAlchemy. The URL shortener allows users to enter long URLs and get a shortened version, which redirects to the original URL when accessed.

Features

Shorten Long URLs: Easily generate shortened URLs for long web addresses.

URL Redirection: Redirect users to the original URL using the shortened link.

Database Integration: Use SQLite to store the original and shortened URLs.

Web Interface: User-friendly interface to enter URLs and display shortened links

Run the Flask app in the terminal/window powershell by navigating through the path of your file, and setting up a Virtual Environment:

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate

Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to use the URL shortener service.
